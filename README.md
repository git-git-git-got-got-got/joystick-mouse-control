### First release ETA?
~~Depending on my day job, I hope to have this completed near the end of August 2020.~~
Going to attempt to write my own C++ module for this, because Robot.js is simply not made for this type of use. 
### Why are you making this?
I know there's a lot of joystick PC control projects out there, but personally don't like the way a lot of them work control wise. Not only that, I've yet to find one that is lightweight, but also has features I personally want. More than anything though, this is a learning experience for me.
### Can I help?
Of course! I'm not sure if this is really even a project anyone would want to collaborate on, seeing as it's most likely going to be a short development period but everyone makes mistakes and >1 pair of eyes is always a good idea.
